                  or investor. The valuation of futures, stocks and options can

                  or debit automatically, using User’s selected payment method,
                  all such amounts. User is responsible for providing to
                  TradersPost and maintaining through the Registration complete
                  and accurate billing and contact information. All TradersPost
                  subscriptions are billed on a recurring monthly or annual
                  basis. User will be automatically billed each month or year
                  until User manually cancel the subscription. TradersPost does

                  please make sure that the subscription is correct before
                  proceeding. If User changes to a different plan, remaining
                  days are converted into an equivalent value of days on the new
                  subscription. TradersPost does not offer refunds for any
                  automatic recurring payments. If User has been billed for
                  automatic renewal of the subscription, User may cancel the
                  subscription to avoid billing for the next renewal date.

                  contacting TradersPost support via email or phone asking for a
                  subscription to be cancelled is not considered cancellation.
                  User may cancel the subscription at any time by logging into
                  User’s account and accessing the Billing section of the
                  account. If User cancels the subscription before the renewal
                  date, User’s service will remain active until the renewal date
                  passes. If no payment is received after the renewal date,
                  User’s paid subscription will be stopped and moved to a free
                  plan, subject to the terms of TradersPost’s then-current

                  <u>Notice of Breach; Cure Period</u>. In the event of a breach
                  of a provision of this Agreement, the notice and cure
                  procedures set forth in this paragraph shall apply. The
                  non-breaching party shall give the breaching party notice
                  describing the breach and stating the time, as provided
                  herein, within which the breach must be cured. If a provision
                  of this Agreement sets forth a cure period for the breach in
                  question, then that provision shall take precedence over any
                  cure period set forth in this paragraph. No cure period shall
                  be required, except as may be provided otherwise in this
                  Agreement, if this Agreement sets forth specific deadline
                  dates for the obligation allegedly breached. If the breach is
                  a material breach of an obligation relating to the other
                  party’s Confidential Information or User’s use or disclosure
                  of the Platform or Documentation other than in compliance with
                  this Agreement, then the non-breaching party, in its sole
                  discretion, may specify in the notice of breach that no cure
                  period will be permitted. If the breach is other than a breach
                  of the kind described above in this paragraph, then the cure
                  period will be 30 days after the notice of the breach by the
                  non-breaching party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
                  TradersPost may immediately terminate this Agreement, or limit
                  access to or suspend User’s account and access to the
                  Platform, without permitting a cure period upon (1) breach or
                  violation of this Agreement or other incorporated agreements
                  or guidelines; (2) a request by law enforcement or other
                  government agency; (3) discontinuance or material modification
                  to the Platform (or any part thereof); (4) unexpected
                  technical or security issues or problems; (5) engagement in
                  fraudulent or illegal activities; (6) nonpayment of any fees
                  owed.

                  period, if any (or upon such breach if no cure period is
                  permitted), then the non-breaching party thereupon may
                  terminate this Agreement by notice to the other party.
                  Termination of this Agreement by TradersPost shall terminate
                  all licenses granted to User herein. Any termination of this

                  disclosure and that was not acquired directly or indirectly

                  party immediately shall move for or otherwise request a stay

                    Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA
                    Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA
                    website www.adr.org. You and TradersPost shall equally share
                    the cost of the arbitration, but each party shall be
                    responsible for its own attorney’s fees. The arbitration may
                    be conducted in person at mutually agreed upon location, or
                    virtually through the submission of documents, by phone, or
                    online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but
                    need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by
                    either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and
                    any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do
                    so. Except as otherwise provided herein, the parties may
                    litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings
                    pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter
                    judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

                  <p>
                    In no event shall any Dispute brought by either party be
                    commenced more than 2 years after the cause of action arose.
                    If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
                    then neither party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
                    falling within that portion of this provision found to be
                    illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided
                    by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts of
                    TradersPost’s home state, and the parties agree to submit to
                    the personal jurisdiction of that court.

                  <p>
                    The parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to
                    the Dispute between the parties individually. To the full
                    extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined
                    with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or
                    authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action
                    basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
                    is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
                    purported representative capacity on behalf of the general
                    public or any other persons.

                <br />
                <li>
                  The party desiring arbitration shall nominate one arbitrator
                  and shall notify the other parties of such nomination. Such
                  other parties shall within ten (10) days after receiving such
                  notice, nominate an arbitrator and the two arbitrators shall
                  select a chairman of the arbitral tribunal to act jointly with
                  them. If the arbitrators shall be unable to agree in the
                  selection of such chairman, the chairman shall be designated
                  by a Judge of the applicable jurisdiction upon an application
                  by any party;
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  If the parties hereto receiving the notice of the nomination
                  of any arbitrator by the party desiring arbitration fail
                  within the said ten (10) days to oppose the nomination of said
                  arbitrator, the nominated arbitrator shall be performed as the
                  arbitrator for the purposes of arbitration under this
                  Agreement. The arbitrator nominated by the party desiring
                  arbitration may proceed alone to determine the dispute in such
                  manner and at such time as he shall think fit and his decision
                  shall, subject to the provisions hereof, be binding upon the
                  parties; and
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any arbitration may be carried
                  out by a single arbitrator if the parties hereto so agree, in
                  writing. In this event, the provisions of this paragraph shall
                  apply mutatis mutandis; to the single arbitrator.

                <br />
                <li>
                  The parties agree to keep confidential the existence of the
                  arbitration, the arbitral proceedings, the submissions made by
                  the parties and the decisions made by the arbitral tribunal,
                  including its awards to the extent not already in the public
                  domain, except in judicial proceedings related to the award or
                  where required by applicable law.

                  <u>Amendments; Waiver</u>. Except as otherwise expressly
                  provided herein, no modification or amendment to this
                  Agreement will be valid or binding unless in writing and duly
                  executed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The
                  failure of either party at any time to require performance by
                  the other party of any provision of this Agreement shall in no
                  way affect the right of such party to require performance of
                  that provision. Any waiver by either party of any breach of
                  this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any
                  continuing or succeeding breach of such provision, a waiver of
                  the provision itself, or a waiver of any right under this
                  Agreement.

                  <u>Entire Agreement</u>. This Agreement constitutes the entire
                  agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter
                  hereof. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
                  agreements, representations, warranties, inducements,
                  promises, and understandings with respect to the Platform, the
                  content, products or services provided by or through
                  TradersPost, and the subject matter of this Agreement. Each
                  party represents and warrants that, in entering into and
                  performing its obligations under this Agreement, it does not
                  and will not rely on any promise, inducement, or
                  representation allegedly made by or on behalf of the other
                  party with respect to the subject matter hereof, nor on any
                  course of dealing or custom and usage in the trade, except as
                  such promise, inducement, or representation may be expressly
                  set forth herein.

                <br />
                <li>
                  <u>Assignment</u>. TradersPost may transfer, assign,
                  sub-contract or otherwise deal with our rights and/or
                  obligations under this Agreement. User may not transfer or
                  assign this Agreement or User’s rights or obligations
                  thereunder.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <u>Severability</u>. If a provision of this Agreement is
                  determined by any court or other competent authority to be
                  unlawful and/or unenforceable, then the invalid or
                  unenforceable provision will be removed from the Agreement,
                  and the other provisions will continue in effect. If any
                  unlawful and/or unenforceable provisions would be lawful or
                  enforceable if part of it were deleted, that part will be
                  deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will
                  continue in effect. A valid and enforceable provision that
                  approximates the intent of the invalid or enforceable
                  provision as closely as possible shall be substituted for the
                  invalid or unenforceable provision.

                <br />
                <li>
                  <u>Governing Law</u>. The laws applicable to the
                  interpretation of this Agreement shall be the laws of the
                  State of Tennessee and applicable federal law, without regard
                  to any conflict of laws rules thereof. Any claims or actions
                  regarding or arising out of this Agreement, if permitted
                  notwithstanding the arbitration requirements, must be brought
                  exclusively in a state or federal court of competent
                  jurisdiction sitting in Sumner County, Tennessee. We make no
                  representation that the Platform is appropriate for access
                  outside of the United States and accessing it from
                  jurisdictions where it is illegal is prohibited.

                  registered U.S. Mail, properly addressed and postage pre-paid,

                  shall be deemed given on the third business day after
                  deposit), (iii) by generally recognized overnight courier,
                  properly addressed and pre-paid, with next business day

                  on the next business day after deposit), or (iv) for
                  TradersPost, by e-mail (in which case such notice shall be
                  deemed given upon transmission unless the party giving notice
                  receives a non-delivery email message within a reasonable time
                  thereafter). Such notices shall be sent to TradersPost at{' '}

                  <u>Nature of Relationship</u>. TradersPost shall provide all
                  services hereunder as an independent contractor to User.
                  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, TradersPost may
                  perform its obligations hereunder through its employees and
                  through subcontractors. Nothing contained herein shall be
                  deemed to create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or
                  other relationship between the parties or any of their
                  Affiliates, and neither party shall have the right, power, or
                  authority under this Agreement to create any duty or
                  obligation on behalf of the other party.

                <br />
                <li>
                  <u>Force Majeure</u>. Neither party shall be liable for any
                  failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement if
                  such failure arises, directly or indirectly, out of causes
                  reasonably beyond the direct control of such party and not due
                  to such party’s own fault or negligence or that of its
                  contractors or representatives or other persons acting on its
                  behalf, and which cannot be overcome by the exercise of due
                  diligence and which could not have been prevented through
                  commercially reasonable measures, including acts of God, acts
                  of terrorists or criminals, acts of domestic or foreign
                  governments, changes in any law or regulation, fires, floods,
                  explosions, epidemics, pandemics, disruptions in
                  communications, power, or other utilities, strikes or other
                  labor problems, riots, or unavailability of supplies.

                  <u>Successors and Assigns</u>. This Agreement will be binding

                  <u>Injunctive Relief</u>. Each party acknowledges that any
                  violation of its covenants in this Agreement relating to the
                  other party’s Confidential Information and intellectual
                  property would result in damage to such party that is largely
                  intangible but nonetheless real and that is incapable of
                  complete remedy by an award of damages. Accordingly, any such
                  violation shall give such party the right to an injunction or
                  other appropriate order to enforce specifically those
                  covenants without bond and without prejudice to any other
                  rights or remedies to which such party may be entitled as a
                  result of a breach of this Agreement.

                  person other than the parties and the respective successors or
                  assigns of the parties, any rights, remedies, obligations, or
