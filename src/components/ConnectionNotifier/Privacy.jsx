            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            A “cookie” is a small file created by a web server that can be
            stored on your device (if you allow) for use either during a
            particular browsing session (a “session” cookie) or a future
            browsing session (a “persistent” or “permanent” cookie). “Session”
            cookies are temporarily stored on your hard drive and only last
            until they expire at the end of your browsing session. “Persistent”
            or “permanent” cookies remain stored on your hard drive until they
            expire or are deleted by you. Local stored objects (or “flash”
            cookies) are used to collect and store information about your
            preferences and navigation to, from, and on a website. First-party
            cookies are set by the website you’re visiting, and they can only be
            read by that site. Third-party cookies are set by a party other than
            that website.

            <u>Other Similar Technologies</u>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In addition to cookies, there are other automatic data collection
            technologies, such as Internet tags, web beacons (clear gifs, pixel
            tags, and single-pixel gifs), and navigational data collection (log
            files, server logs, etc.) that can be used to collect data as users
            navigate through and interact with a website:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <u>Web beacons</u>: These are tiny graphics (sometimes called
              “clear GIFs” or “web pixels”) with unique identifiers that are
              used to understand browsing activity. In contrast to cookies,
              which are stored on a user’s device, web beacons are rendered
              invisible on web pages when you open a page.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <u>Social Widgets</u>: These are buttons or icons provided by
              third-party social media platforms that allow you to interact with
              social media services when you view a webpage or mobile app
              screen. These social widgets may collect browsing data, which may
              be received by the third party that provided the widget and are
              controlled by third parties.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <u>UTM Codes</u>: These are strings that can appear in a URL (the
              “Uniform Resource Locator,” which is typically the http or https
              address entered to go to a webpage) when you move from one web
              page or website to another. The string can represent information
              about browsing, such as which advertisement, page, or publisher
              sent the user to the receiving website.
            </li>

            <strong>Google Tag Manager</strong>. We use Google Tag Manager,

            The tool itself (which implements the tags) does not use cookies and
            does not register identifiable data. The tool causes other tags to
            be activated which may, for their part, register personal data under
            certain circumstances. Google Tag Manager does not access this

            We retain the personal information we receive as described in this
            Policy for as long as you use our services or as necessary to
            fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, to provide our
            services, to resolve disputes, to establish legal defenses, to
            conduct audits, to pursue legitimate business purposes, to enforce
            our agreements, and to comply with our business requirements and
            applicable laws.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We take reasonable steps to delete the personal information we
            collect when (1) we have a legal obligation to do so, (2) we no
            longer have a purpose for retaining the information, and (3) if you
            ask us to delete your information, unless we determine that doing so
            would violate our existing, legitimate legal, regulatory, dispute
            resolution, contractual, or similar obligations. We may also decide
            to delete your personal information if we believe it is incomplete,
            inaccurate, or that our continued storage of your personal
            information is contrary to our legal obligations or business
            objectives. When we delete personal information, it will be removed
            from our active servers and databases; but, it may remain in our
            archives when it is not practical or possible to delete it.

            To the extent permitted by law, we may retain and use anonymous and

          <h3>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
          <p>
            <br />
            We take commercially reasonable steps to protect personal
            information against unauthorized disclosure, use, access,
            alteration, or loss. You can learn more about our security practices{' '}
            <a href='/security'>here</a>. We do not store or save your financial
            information. From time to time, we review our security procedures to
            consider appropriate new technology and methods.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            However, no security system is perfect, and no data transmission
            over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore,
            while we strive to protect user information, we cannot guarantee or
            warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from
            the Site. You engage in such transmissions at your own risk. We
            cannot promise that your personal information will remain absolutely
            secure in all circumstances.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The safety and security of your personal information also depends on
            you. If you use the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the
            confidentiality of your account and for restricting access to your
            computer or device, and you agree to accept responsibility for all
            activities that occur under your account. You are responsible for
            keeping your password confidential. If you believe your Personal
            Information is being improperly used by us or any third party,

            law and in accordance with our agreements with our data controller
            customers.

            We are located and established in the United States and, therefore,
            your personal information may be transferred to, stored, or
            processed in the United States. While the data protection, privacy
            and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as
            those in your country, we take necessary and appropriate steps to
            protect the privacy and security of your personal information. By
            using the Site or requesting services from us, you understand and
            consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your
            information to our facilities in the United States and those third
            parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy.

          <p>
            When storing, hosting, or otherwise processing your information
            (including personal data), we may send such data outside of the EU
            and the EEA. When we transfer information to the United States or
            other countries, we do so for the purposes set forth in this Policy
            and in accordance with applicable law. We rely on recognized legal
            bases to lawfully conduct cross-border/international transfers of
            personal information outside of the EU and EEA, such as your express
            informed consent to do so (as noted above), when transfer is
            necessary for us to deliver services pursuant to an agreement
            between us and you, for the conclusion or performance of a contract
            concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller
            and another natural or legal person, or when the transfer is subject
            to safeguards that assure the protection of your personal
            information, such as the European Commission’s approved standard
            contractual clauses.

          <h3>CHILDREN UNDER 18</h3>
          <p>
            <br />
            The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), as well as
            other data privacy regulations, restrict the collection, use, or
            disclosure of personal information from and about children on the
            Internet. The Site is restricted to the use of adults over the age
            of majority in their place of residence. No portion of the Site is
            directed to children under the age of 18, and no one under the age
            of 18 may access, browse, or use the Site or provide any information
            to or on the Site. Consequently, we do not knowingly collect
            personal identifying information from any person under the age of
            18. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a
            child under age 18 without a parent’s or legal guardian’s consent,
            we will take steps to stop collecting that information and delete
            that information as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or
            guardian of a child under 18 years of age and you believe your child
            has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us at{' '}
