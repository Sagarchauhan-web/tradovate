          only where permitted by applicable law, we may process personal
          information (1) when required by law; (2) to create, use, retain, or

            The establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, whether in

            assertion of our legal rights, your legal rights, and the legal
            rights of others.);

          We may process your personal information in connection with any of the

            necessary, provided those interests are not overridden by your
            interests or fundamental rights and freedoms;
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>

          <br />

          <u>First and Third-Party Cookies</u>
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          A “cookie” is a small file created by a web server that can be stored
          on your device (if you allow) for use either during a particular
          browsing session (a “session” cookie) or a future browsing session (a
          “persistent” or “permanent” cookie). “Session” cookies are temporarily
          stored on your hard drive and only last until they expire at the end
          of your browsing session. “Persistent” or “permanent” cookies remain
          stored on your hard drive until they expire or are deleted by you.
          Local stored objects (or “flash” cookies) are used to collect and
          store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and
          on a website. First-party cookies are set by the website you’re
          visiting, and they can only be read by that site. Third-party cookies
          are set by a party other than that website.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Other Similar Technologies</u>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In addition to cookies, there are other automatic data collection
          technologies, such as Internet tags, web beacons (clear gifs, pixel
          tags, and single-pixel gifs), and navigational data collection (log
          files, server logs, etc.) that can be used to collect data as users
          navigate through and interact with a website:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u>Web beacons</u>: These are tiny graphics (sometimes called “clear
            GIFs” or “web pixels”) with unique identifiers that are used to
            understand browsing activity. In contrast to cookies, which are
            stored on a user’s device, web beacons are rendered invisible on web
            pages when you open a page.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <u>Social Widgets</u>: These are buttons or icons provided by
            third-party social media platforms that allow you to interact with
            social media services when you view a webpage or mobile app screen.
            These social widgets may collect browsing data, which may be
            received by the third party that provided the widget and are
            controlled by third parties.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <u>UTM Codes</u>: These are strings that can appear in a URL (the
            “Uniform Resource Locator,” which is typically the http or https
            address entered to go to a webpage) when you move from one web page
            or website to another. The string can represent information about
            browsing, such as which advertisement, page, or publisher sent the
            user to the receiving website.
          </li>

          <strong>Google Tag Manager</strong>. We use Google Tag Manager, which

          not register identifiable data. The tool causes other tags to be
          activated which may, for their part, register personal data under
          certain circumstances. Google Tag Manager does not access this
          information. Google Tag Manager is subject to the Google Privacy

          We retain the personal information we receive as described in this
          Policy for as long as you use our services or as necessary to fulfill
          the purpose(s) for which it was collected, to provide our services, to
          resolve disputes, to establish legal defenses, to conduct audits, to
          pursue legitimate business purposes, to enforce our agreements, and to
          comply with our business requirements and applicable laws.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We take reasonable steps to delete the personal information we collect
          when (1) we have a legal obligation to do so, (2) we no longer have a
          purpose for retaining the information, and (3) if you ask us to delete
          your information, unless we determine that doing so would violate our
          existing, legitimate legal, regulatory, dispute resolution,
          contractual, or similar obligations. We may also decide to delete your
          personal information if we believe it is incomplete, inaccurate, or
          that our continued storage of your personal information is contrary to
          our legal obligations or business objectives. When we delete personal
          information, it will be removed from our active servers and databases;
          but, it may remain in our archives when it is not practical or
          possible to delete it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by law, we may retain and use anonymous and

        <h3>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
        <p>
          <br />
          We take commercially reasonable steps to protect personal information
          against unauthorized disclosure, use, access, alteration, or loss. You
          can learn more about our security practices{' '}
          <a href='/security'>here</a>. We do not store or save your financial
          information. From time to time, we review our security procedures to
          consider appropriate new technology and methods.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, no security system is perfect, and no data transmission over
          the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we
          strive to protect user information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the
          security of any information you transmit to us or from the Site. You
          engage in such transmissions at your own risk. We cannot promise that
          your personal information will remain absolutely secure in all
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The safety and security of your personal information also depends on
          you. If you use the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the
          confidentiality of your account and for restricting access to your
          computer or device, and you agree to accept responsibility for all
          activities that occur under your account. You are responsible for
          keeping your password confidential. If you believe your Personal
          Information is being improperly used by us or any third party, please

        </p>
        <p>
          If a security breach compromises your data, we will notify you and any
          applicable regulator when we are required to do so by applicable law
          and in accordance with our agreements with our data controller

        <h3>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          <br />
          We are located and established in the United States and, therefore,
          your personal information may be transferred to, stored, or processed
          in the United States. While the data protection, privacy and other
          laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in
          your country, we take necessary and appropriate steps to protect the
          privacy and security of your personal information. By using the Site
          or requesting services from us, you understand and consent to the
          collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information to
          our facilities in the United States and those third parties with whom
          we share it as described in this Policy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When storing, hosting, or otherwise processing your information
          (including personal data), we may send such data outside of the EU and
          the EEA. When we transfer information to the United States or other
          countries, we do so for the purposes set forth in this Policy and in
          accordance with applicable law. We rely on recognized legal bases to
          lawfully conduct cross-border/international transfers of personal
          information outside of the EU and EEA, such as your express informed
          consent to do so (as noted above), when transfer is necessary for us
          to deliver services pursuant to an agreement between us and you, for
          the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest
          of the data subject between the controller and another natural or
          legal person, or when the transfer is subject to safeguards that
          assure the protection of your personal information, such as the
          European Commission’s approved standard contractual clauses.

        <h3>CHILDREN UNDER 18</h3>
        <p>
          <br />
          The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), as well as
          other data privacy regulations, restrict the collection, use, or
          disclosure of personal information from and about children on the
          Internet. The Site is restricted to the use of adults over the age of
          majority in their place of residence. No portion of the Site is
          directed to children under the age of 18, and no one under the age of
          18 may access, browse, or use the Site or provide any information to
          or on the Site. Consequently, we do not knowingly collect personal
          identifying information from any person under the age of 18. If we
          learn that we have collected personal information from a child under
          age 18 without a parent’s or legal guardian’s consent, we will take
          steps to stop collecting that information and delete that information
          as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or guardian of a child
          under 18 years of age and you believe your child has provided us with
          Personal Information, please contact us at{' '}
