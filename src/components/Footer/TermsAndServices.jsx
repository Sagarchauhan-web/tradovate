      <DialogDescription>
        <p>
          From everyone at PickMyTrade, thank you for using our product. When we
          say “PickMyTrade”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are
          referring to PickMyTrade, a company registered in the State of
          Rajasthan (India). When we say “Service”, or “Services”, we mean any
          product created and maintained by PickMyTrade, whether delivered
          within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or
          another format. We may update these Terms of Service in the future.
          Typically, these changes have been to clarify some of these terms by
          linking to an expanded related policy. When you use our Services, now
          or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service.
          That’s true for any of our existing and future products and all
          features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times
          where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the
          Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or
          provision. These terms do contain a limitation of our liability. If
          you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That’s a
          broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us.
          We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about who we are,
          how we work, and keeping an open door to your feedback.
        </p>

          <li>
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
            password, or social login. PickMyTrade or its officers, directors,
            employees, consultants, or contractors cannot and will not be liable

          Safe Harbor exception clause
        </h4>

        <p>
          Because we run a Bug Bounty Program, we don’t want researchers to be
          in fear of consequences because of their good faith attempts to comply
          with our Bug Bounty Program terms. To encourage research and
          coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities, we will not pursue
          civil or criminal action, or send notice to law enforcement for
          accidental or good faith violations of these Terms of Service. We
          consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities
          conducted consistent with our Bug Bounty Program terms to be
          “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the DMCA,
          and other applicable computer use laws such as Cal. Penal Code 502(c).
          We waive any potential DMCA claim against you for circumventing the
          technological measures we have used to protect the applications in our
          Bug Bounty Program’s scope. Please understand that if your security
          research involves the networks, systems, information, applications,
          products, or services of a third party (which is not us), we cannot
          bind that third party, and they may pursue legal action or law
          enforcement notice. We cannot and do not authorize security research
          in the name of other entities, and cannot in any way offer to defend,
          indemnify, or otherwise protect you from any third party action based
          on your actions. You are expected, as always, to comply with all laws
          applicable to you, and not to disrupt or compromise any data beyond
          what this Bug Bounty Program permits. Please contact us before
          engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by
          this policy. We reserve the sole right to make the determination of
          whether a violation of this policy is accidental or in good faith, and
          proactive contact to us before engaging in any action is a significant
          factor in that decision. If in doubt, ask us first!

          <li>
            If you are using a free version of the Services, it is really free:
            we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for users who
            pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.
          </li>
          <li>
            For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of
            trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay in
            advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we downgrade
            your account to a free account.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge
            your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of
            upgrade.
          </li>
          <li>
            All fees are inclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
            taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on
            behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing
            authorities.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We process refunds on a case-by-case basis in 15 days. If you’re ever
          unhappy with our Services for any reason, just contact our support
          team and we’ll take care of you.

        <ul className='my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2'>
          <li>
            You are solely responsible for properly canceling and deleting your
            account. An email request to cancel your account is not considered
            cancellation. If you need help canceling your account, you can
            always contact our Support team.
          </li>
          <li>
            All of your information and data will be inaccessible from the
            Services immediately upon cancellation. We might have the
            information in a temporary backup for a few weeks but we cannot
            recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse
            any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at
            any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account
            will not be able to access the account or any content in the
            account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your
            account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and
            relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the
            right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at
            any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of
            the hundreds of thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at
            least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we
            staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that
            stance.

            Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse
            or retribution) of an PickMyTrade employee, officer, or agent may
            result in immediate account termination.

            Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or
            we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be
            better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve
            the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or
            permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most of our Services are free, but some are not, and sometimes we
            may change the pricing structure. When we do that, we may choose to
            change the prices for existing users. If we do so, we will give at
            least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on
            record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or
            the affected Services themselves.

          We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the

          is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no
          guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or
          expectations. We also test all of our features extensively before
          making them available. As with any software, our Services inevitably
          have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through
          priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all
          reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely
          error-free Services.

          such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the

          services resulting from any goods, data, information or services
          purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered
