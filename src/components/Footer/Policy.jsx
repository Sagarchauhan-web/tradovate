        Privacy Policy
      </DialogTitle>
      <DialogDescription>
        <p>
          The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big
          deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why;
          how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we
          never sell your data: never have, never will. This policy applies to
          all products built and maintained by pickmytrade. Whenever you want,
          you can download, export or delete everything you have uploaded on
          pickmytrade. As we said, they are your data – not ours.
        </p>

        <h4 className='mt-8 mb-4 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight'>
          What we collect and why
        </h4>
        <p>
          Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what
          that means in practice:
        </p>
        <h4 className='mt-8 mb-4 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight'>
          Identity & access
        </h4>
        <p>
          When you sign up for a pickmytrade product, we typically ask for
          identifying information such as your name and email address. That’s
          just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you
          updates, or other essential information. That does not mean you have
          to give us your real name, you can make one up if you prefer; but an
          email address you have access to is needed to activate your account.
          If you opt for a native login, we may give you the option in the
          future to add a profile picture (with social login we’ll use the
          picture you have chosen for that platform) that displays in our
          products, but we do not normally look at or access that picture. We’ll
          never sell your personal information to third parties, and we won’t
          use your name or company in marketing statements without your
          permission either.
        </p>
        <h4 className='mt-8 mb-4 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight'>
          Geolocation data
        </h4>
        <p>
          We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can
          always verify no unauthorized access has happened. We may keep this
          login data for as long as your product account is active. We also log
          full IP addresses used to sign up a product account. We may keep this
          record forever because they are used to mitigate spammy signups. Web
          analytics data may also be tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist
          with troubleshooting cases.
        </p>
        <h4 className='mt-8 mb-4 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight'>
          Website interactions
        </h4>
        <p>
          When you browse our pages or applications, your browser automatically
          shares certain information such as which operating system and browser
          version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages
          you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for
          statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We
          sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design
          decisions. These web analytics data are tied to your IP address and
          user account if applicable and you are signed into our Services.
        </p>
        <h4 className='mt-8 mb-4 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight'>
          Cookies and Do Not Track
        </h4>
        <p>
          We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences,
          make it easier for you to use our applications, and support some
          in-house analytics. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser
          to help it remember your login information, site preferences, and
          more. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To
          learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have
          been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit:

        <h4 className='mt-8 mb-4 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight'>
          Voluntary correspondence
        </h4>
        <p>
          When you write pickmytrade with a question or to ask for help, we keep
          that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a
          history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the
          future. We also store any information you volunteer like surveys.
          Sometimes when we do user interviews, we may ask for your permission
          to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so
          if you give your express consent.
        </p>
        <h4 className='mt-8 mb-4 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight'>
          Information we do not collect
        </h4>
        <p>
          We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications
          including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender
          identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or
          disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you
          include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into
          our Support team. We also do not collect any biometric data. You may
          be given the option to add a picture to your user profile, which could
          be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that
          represents you best. We do not extract any information from profile
          pictures: they are for your use alone.
        </p>
        <h4 className='mt-8 mb-4 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight'>
          When we access or share your information
        </h4>
        <p>
          Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times
          we’ll ever access or share your info are: To provide products or
          services you’ve requested. We do use some third-party services to run
          our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all
          of your personal information via these third parties. Having
          sub-processors means we are using technology to access your data. No
          pickmytrade human looks at your data for these purposes. To help you
          troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission. If at any
          point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case,
          we will ask for your consent before proceeding. When required under
          applicable law. If pickmytrade is acquired — we don’t plan on that,
          but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before any info about you is
          transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

        <h4 className='mt-8 mb-4 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight'>
          Your rights with respect to your information
        </h4>
        <p>
          At pickmytrade, we apply the same data rights to all users, regardless
          of their location. Currently, the most privacy-forward regulations in
          place are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation
          (“GDPR”). pickmytrade recognizes all of the rights granted in these
          regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights
          include:
        </p>
        <ul className='my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2'>
          <li>
            Right to Know. You have the right to know what personal information
            is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories
            and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used,
            in this privacy policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right of Access. This includes your right to access the personal
            information we gather about you, and your right to obtain
            information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of
            that information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to Correction. You have the right to request correction of
            your personal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”. This is your right to request,
            subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your
            personal information be erased from our possession and, by
            extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data
            deletion requests may prevent you from using pickmytrade services
            because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a
            data deletion request may result in closing your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to Complain. You have the right to make a complaint regarding
            our handling of your personal information with the appropriate
            supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find
            out more about this right, EU individuals should go to
            https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to Restrict Processing. This is your right to request
            restriction of how and why your personal information is used or
            processed, including opting out of sale of personal information.
            (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data).
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to Object. You have the right, in certain situations, to
            object to how or why your personal information is processed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to Portability. You have the right to receive the personal
            information we have about you and the right to transmit it to
            another party.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making. You have the
            right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or
            similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on
            automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision
            is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is
            allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to Non-Discrimination. This right stems from the CCPA. We do
            not and will not offer you different services, or give you a lower
            level of user service because you have exercised your data privacy
            rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right
            “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights,
            prevent you from using our Services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly
          updating your account information. If you have questions about
          exercising these rights or need assistance, please let us know through
          the Contact Us form. For requests to delete personal information or
          know what personal information has been collected, we will first
          verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of
          information already collected including your user email address. If an
          authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need
          written consent with a signature from the account holder before
          proceeding. If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific
          authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR, at
          https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en.

          How we secure your data
        </h4>
        <p>
          All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to
          your browser. Some of the database data are also encrypted. For
          products, some data are not encrypted while they live in our database
          (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we
          go to great lengths to secure your data at rest. For more information
          about how we keep your information secure, please review our Security
          Overview.

          What happens when you delete data in your account
        </h4>
        <p>
          We give you the option to delete your data. Anything you delete is
          gone from the application. We also delete your data after an account
          is closed. This applies both for cases when an account owner directly
          closes and for accounts closed by us. The account data might remain in
          our temporary backups for up to 90 days but afterwards it will be
          deleted forever. Location of site and data Our services and other web
          properties are distributed across several locations across America,
          Europe and Asia. Please be aware that any information you provide to
          us might be transferred to and stored in a jurisdiction different from
          your residency. By using our Site, participating in any of our
          services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to
          this transfer. Transfer of personal data from the EU. The GDPR
          requires that any data transferred out of the EU must be treated with
          the same level of protection that the EU privacy laws grant. That is
          why since GDPR went into effect, PickMyTrade has offered a data
          processing addendum. We have incorporated a Data Processing Addendum
          to our Terms of Service that is in effect when the GDPR applies to
          your use of PickMyTrade Services to process User Data as defined in
          the DPA.
